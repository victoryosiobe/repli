# Repli

Check the how close texts are with repli.

# Currently, you can:
- Find measures of how similar 2 texts are.
- You could also check if texts are verbatim.
- You could pick an option to check if all words in 1 text is present in the other.

**The biggest update** was to the **Similar Text Algorithm**, and soon, if I've got some time, I'd build the **Plagiarism Algorithm**.
